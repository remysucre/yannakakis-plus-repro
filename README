Put imdb parquet files here (you can use DuckDB to export into parquet format).
First load data into DuckDB with `load.sql`, then run `all.sql` and save result to `time.txt`.
Finally, run `extract_final_timings.py` to parse and extract.
The timing is printed out in lex order, i.e. 10a is the first one.
